John, Sahil, and Jarod
An overview on your project / project idea.
For the group project, we chose to build a web crawler built with the open source library Scrapy.
Goals of your software 
Our app will be used to scrape a subreddit for keywords that are used primarily in that subreddit.
Resources used to build your software i.e. any open source libraries used, tools used or any existing open source project. 
We will use the scrapy open source library, and will possibly need an open source language tool to determine the uniqueness words to a subreddit
Mention how you would use these resources in your project.
The scrapy library will give us the resources we need in order to build a web scraper, without needing to know the in-depth details of how they work
If developing from an existing project mention what new features you would add.
We will be creating our own project, so there would not be new features to add, we will however be utilizing open source libraries
